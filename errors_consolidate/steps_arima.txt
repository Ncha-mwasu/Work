Step 1: Generate markov errors (mae, mse) and remaining energies result file
 - adjust MARKOV_PREDICTION_INTERVALS in run.py line 286
 - run the program: python run.py (It takes very long to complete depending on MAX_ROUNDS & NB_NODES)
 - output 1: Markov mae and mse aggregates in "../errors_consolidate_parallel.txt"
 - output 2: remaining energies file in "../results/<DATE_PROGRAM_RAN>/<TIME_PROGRAM_RAN>/remaining_energies/MLC/arima/actual_remaining_energies.csv"
 - convert output 1 to json: pass the path to output 1 as an argument to the code in "./json_worker.py"

Step 2: Use remaining energies data from step 1 to generate arima (mae, mse)
 - adjust ARIMA_FORECAST_LENGTH in run_arima.py line 305
 - pass the path to output 2 in Step 1 to "../run_arima.py" line 310
 - replace errors_parllel.json with the new errors_parallel.json generated in the last item of Step 1
 - run the program: python run_arima.py (It takes very long to complete)
 - Final consolidated results deposited in "./errors_parllel.json"
